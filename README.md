# Turtle-Polygon-Lab
Replace the  `'''missing code'''` comments with the appropriate code to make the turtle move in the shape of a square, pentagon, hexagon and octagon with a given side length. 

Then write the function to move the turtle in a regular polygon with a given length and number of sides.

Then call the `polygon(len, sides)` function inside `main()` 3 times to draw the required polygons.
